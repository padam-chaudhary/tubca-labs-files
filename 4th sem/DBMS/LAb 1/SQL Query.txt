SQL Query
lab 1:
A)Create database:
Create a new database named “college_db”.
CREATE DATABASE college_db;

B)Create a new table named “students” with following fields and appropriate data types:
std_id
name
dob

Here std_id should be auto incremented, and set as a primary key. name cannot have NULL values while dob can be blank.
=>USE college_db;
//college table:
CREATE TABLE students(
std_id int AUTO_INCREMENT,
 name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
 dob DATE NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(std_id)
);

C)Add a new field named ‘batch’ at the last.
=>USE college_db;
//college table:
CREATE TABLE students(
std_id int AUTO_INCREMENT,
 name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
 dob DATE NULL,
  batch int,
    PRIMARY KEY(std_id)
);


D)Create another test table with some random fields and practice removing columns and the whole table as well using the DROP command.


//test table:
USE college_db;

CREATE TABLE test(
testNo int AUTO_INCREMENT,
 sub VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
   score int NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(testNo)
);

=> DROP/delete column
ALTER TABLE test
DROP  COLUMN score;

=> drop/delete table
DROP TABLE test;


Lab #2: Keys and data types
A)Create a new table named Courses with the following fields:
course_id
name
credit_hrs
university
=>USE college_db;

CREATE TABLE Courses(
course_id int  AUTO_INCREMENT,
   name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    credit_hrs int NOT NULL,
    university VARCHAR(100),
    PRIMARY KEY(course_id)
);


B)Add a new column in Students table named “course_id” and set it as a foreign key to course_id of Courses table.
=>ALTER TABLE students
ADD course_id int;
ALTER TABLE students
ADD FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES courses(course_id);

C)Add some relevant data to both tables. Add at least 5 courses and 10 students. More students added is better.

students table::
=>USE college_db;
-- insert 10 values into students table
INSERT INTO students(std_id,name,dob,batch) VALUES(NULL,"Sushant.k","2002-5-12",2079),
(NULL,"Sushant.s","2004-4-6",2079),
(NULL,"ram","2007-6-11",2079),
(NULL,"suhesh","2004-4-6",2079),(NULL,"padam","2003-10-12",2079),(NULL,"Sumit.R","2004-6-25",2079),
(NULL,"Niraj Tharu","2005-6-20",2079),(NULL,"Niruta Thapa","2004-3-25",2079),(NULL,"Namrata .G","2003-2-28",2079),
(NULL,"Mahesh .K","2004-1-24",2079);

-- inset 5 values  into course table
INSERT INTO courses(course_id,name,credit_hrs,university) VALUES(NULL,"BCA",126,"Tribhuwan"),(NULL,"BBA",120,"Tribhuwan"),
(NULL,"BBM",120,"Tribhuwan"),(NULL,"csit",126,"Tribhuwan"),(NULL,"BBS",120,"Tribhuwan");


D)Display all data inserted in the ‘Students’ table.
=>SELECT * FROM college_db.students;
